# FYS3150 Computational Physics

Projects in the course [FYS3150 Computational Physics](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/h17/index.html) at the University of Oslo. 
## Usage
Usage is project specific. We use qt creator for compiling c++, and a combination of python, terminal and bash for creating input files, running the executable, and analysing output.  

## Descriptions
### Project 1
Poisson equation. Spherically symmetric case solved using Thomas algorithm.
- Was done in collaberation with others at [another repo](https://www.github.com/Caronthir/FYS3150). Split into two groups due to crowding.

### Project 2
Two electrons in a harmonic oscillator potential. Sch√∂dinger equation solved using the Jacobi algorithm and LU decomposition.

### Project 3
Celestial bodies in a vacuum. Newtonian dynamics with relativistic correction for Mercury solved using Velocity Verlet in an  Object Oriented approach.

### Project 4
Phase transitions of the two dimensional Ising Model. Studied using the Metropolis algorithm.
- Individual reports

### Project 5
??? Choice between MD, diffusion, wave or economics
