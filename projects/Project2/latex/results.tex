The stability analysis of the jacobi solver did not converge to the
analytical value for increasing $\rhomax$, as this increased the step size
and caused reduced precision. For $N=200$, a $\rhomax$ of $\approx 5$ was
found ideal for the third wavefunction in the non interacting harmonic
oscillator. Then setting $\rhomax$ equal to
